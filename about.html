      <p>
        I am Alanis Benitez, a multidisciplinary creative whose work blends storytelling, music, and design. This page offers a snapshot of recent projects—each shaped by the people, places, and ideas that continue to inspire me.

        Born in Paraguay and shaped by experiences in New York, Panamá, and Spain, my work reflects a global perspective rooted in my cultural identity. I hold a degree in Digital Media and Communications from IE University, where I developed a foundation in creative writing, documentary filmmaking, music videos, marketing, and web development.

        As a multidisciplinary artist, choosing a single medium has never defined me. Instead, I focus on expanding my skills and exploring new ways to express ideas. Whether through a camera lens, a written narrative, or a design piece, my goal is to create work that resonates, tells a story, and sparks emotion.
